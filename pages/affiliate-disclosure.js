                        <p className="mb-0">Some of the links on this site are affiliate links. This means that if you click on one of these links and make a purchase, we may receive a small commission — <strong>at no additional cost to you.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>These commissions help fund the maintenance of Bookssstore.com, allowing us to keep creating and sharing content that helps you discover great books.</p>

                        <h4 className="mb-0">2. Our Editorial Integrity</h4>
                        <p>Our recommendations are based on quality, usefulness, and value to you — not on potential earnings. Affiliate links do not influence our editorial decisions, reviews, or book lists. We strive to present honest opinions and valuable guidance so you can make informed decisions.</p>

                        <h4 className="mb-0">3. Your Trust Matters</h4>
                        <p className="mb-0">We understand and respect the trust you place in us. Transparency is a core part of our relationship with readers, and we aim to be clear about how our site operates.</p>
